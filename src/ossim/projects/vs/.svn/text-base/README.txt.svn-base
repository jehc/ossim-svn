------------------OSSIM VS2005 Solution--------------------
Maintained By: David A. Horner - (http://dave.thehorners.com)

The solution and project files in this folder are generated with
the updatesolution program.  The projects assume certain libraries
exist one directory above the ossim tree.  If your build environment
does not match this, you'll need to regenerate solution/projects with
updatesolution.

There is a README.txt in updatesolution with more details.
