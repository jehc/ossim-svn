For the Mac build.

Building with xcode (Panther OSX 10.3 or greater)
Assumes that ossim and ossim_qt are side by side directories residing in /Users/Shared/Development

You will need to install qt version 3.2.3 (the beta 3.3 had some compatibility problems)  you can find it at ftp.trolltech.com.


Building from the terminal:

run the following script:

./macstager.sh ossim_qt.pro

set the OSSIM_HOME environmental variable to point to the the top of the ossim tree

setenv OSSIM_HOME ~mlucas/Development/ossim

also added jpeg header files to /usr/local/include


qmake imagelinker.pro
make


there is also a target in the ossim.xcode project that assumes that ossim_qt is alongside ossim in the diretory structure.
