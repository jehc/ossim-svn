To build Library

Make

to build test executables in main directory:

make image_open
make image_data
make image_copy

this copies executables into bin/

to run test code

./test.sh


the file ossim_ada.pbproj is a project file for os x IDE
copy_ali.sh is part of os x IDE scripts to install the library

test_files are some simple test files

Source
	test program source code
	C_Bindings   -  c bindings to the c++ classes
	Ada_Bindings -  Ada bindings.
	
	
	the ada tagged types mostly mirror the ossim class structure which is documented on ossim website.
	
	
let me know if you have questions. i am working on a UML model of the bindings.  the test code though shows how easy it is to use.  for example ossim_copy test shows how to take a dted file and convert it to jpeg (use image_copy with no arguments to see the list of file types it knows how to write, it can read many more types than it can read)
